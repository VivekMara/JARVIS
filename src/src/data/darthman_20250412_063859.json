The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. CDNs serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics, and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social networks.\n\nAnswer: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers designed to deliver internet content more efficiently by reducing latency and improving load times. CDNs are widely used for various types of content, including web pages, media files, and applications, ensuring high availability and performance for end users. They work by caching content in multiple locations around the world, allowing users to access data from the nearest server."
