If you were asking whether tea has a \"capital\" in a metaphorical sense, some might refer to regions like Assam in India or Hangzhou in China (known for Longjing tea) as significant tea-producing areas, but it doesn't have an official capital like a country does. Could you clarify what you meant by \"the same case\"?"
